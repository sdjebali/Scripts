# geom_histogram_by_factor.sh (following model of geom_density_by_factor.sh)
# Make histogram plot for a numeric column of a tsv file but splitting the data by a factor provided as another column in the tsv file
# - takes as input
#   * the input tsv file with header, from which the numeric column and the factor will be taken
#   * the id of the column we want to plot in the header of the input file
#   * the id in the header of the input file of the column in which the factor is
#   * a one word label for the x axis which is the meaning of the column in question and that will give the name to the output file
#   * a string with minimum and maximum values for the column in question (min-max)
#   * a string to put as a title of the plot
#   * an optional number of bins (50 by default)
# - produces as output and in the same directory as the input:
#   * a png file (named after the one word label of the column and to the factor name), with the histogram plot of this column
# Note: needs R with ggplot2 library to be available
