# geom_density_by_factor.sh
# Make density plot for a column in a tsv file but splitting the data by a factor provided as another column in the tsv file
# - takes as input
#   * the input tsv file with header, from which the column to be plotted and the factor will be taken, the 1st one has to be numeric, the other one not
#   * the id in the header of the input file of the column we want to plot 
#   * the id in the header of the input file of the column in which the factor is
#   * a one word label for the x axis which is the meaning of the column in question
#   * a one word label for the title of the plot
#   * the min and max to zoom in for the x axis
# - produces as output and in the same directory as the input file:
#   * a png file (named after the one word label of the column and to the factor name), with the density plot of this column split according to the factor
# Note: needs reshape2 and ggplot2 libraries to be installed
